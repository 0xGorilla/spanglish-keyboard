# Spanglish Keyboard

Are you a spanish speaker and user of MacOS? Are you tired of switching keyboards or long pressing vowels to get the "tilde"?

A few years ago I created a Spanglish keyboard for MacOS which helps me type tildes faster, while still using the english keyboard. It's actually the only keyboard I use.

The Spanglish keyboard is just an english keyboard with the following additions:
```
Option + a: á
Option + e: é
Option + i: í
Option + o: ó
Option + u: ú
Option + ?: ¿
Option + !: ¡
```

Wanna use it? It takes ~3 minutes to install


1. Download this repository as a zip file directly in Github
2. Move `Spanglish Keyboard.bundle` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
3. Reboot (trust me, it will be worth it)
4. Go to: Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Input -> Input Sources -> Edit
5. Click on the + on the bottom left
6. Add the Spanglish version under English
7. Enjoy!
